<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!-- Page 5: Problem Statement -->
<h2>4. Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
  Prior to this project, Y.F Enterprises, despite its significant real-world engineering achievements, faced a critical gap in the digital sphere. The company lacked a unified, professional, or accessible online presence.
</p>
<h3>Key Issues Identified:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Lack of Visibility:</b> Potential clients, partners, and talent (both domestic and international) had no central, reliable source to find information about the company, its services, or its track record.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Inefficient Communication:</b> All inquiries, whether from potential clients or job seekers, were handled through scattered, manual methods (e.g., direct emails, phone calls). This process was inefficient, difficult to track, and prone to delays.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Weak Brand Image:</b> In an increasingly digital world, the absence of a modern website projected an outdated image, which was not reflective of the company's high-tech, innovative engineering solutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>No Portfolio Showcase:</b> The company had no effective way to digitally showcase its impressive portfolio of completed projects, a key factor in building trust and credibility with new clients.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Therefore, the problem was to develop a comprehensive, secure, and responsive website that would solve these issues by centralizing information, streamlining communication, and elevating the company's brand to match its real-world capabilities.
</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!-- Page 6: Technology Stack Used -->
<h2>5. Technology Stack Used</h2>
<p>
  The selection of technologies was crucial to meet the project's objectives of creating a modern, high-performance, and maintainable website.
</p>

<h3>Frontend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>React.js:</b> Chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for the creation of reusable UI elements. This improves development speed and long-term maintainability. Its virtual DOM ensures a fast and responsive user experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tailwind CSS:</b> A utility-first CSS framework selected for its ability to rapidly prototype and build custom designs directly in the HTML. It eliminates the need for large, custom CSS files and enforces a consistent design system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) & Locomotive Scroll:</b> These libraries were used in conjunction to create professional-grade, smooth-scrolling parallax effects and intricate animations. This was vital for giving the site a modern, engaging feel that captures user attention.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Backend</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Node.js:</b> Used to build a lightweight, efficient REST API. Its asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model makes it perfectly suited for handling form submissions and other simple server-side tasks without requiring a heavy, monolithic backend.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Vercel:</b> Chosen as the deployment platform for the Node.js API. Its seamless Git integration, serverless functions, and automatic scaling provide a robust, cost-effective solution for hosting backend services.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment & Hosting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Hostinger:</b> Selected for hosting the frontend React application. It provides a user-friendly control panel, reliable uptime, and straightforward integration of SSL certificates (HTTPS), which is essential for site security and user trust.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Git & GitHub:</b> Used for version control. All code was managed in a GitHub repository, allowing for systematic tracking of changes, collaboration, and simplified deployment workflows to both Hostinger and Vercel.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!-- Page 7: System Architecture & Workflow -->
<h2>6. System Architecture & Workflow</h2>
<p>
  The system employs a decoupled, or "headless," architecture. The frontend (client) is entirely separate from the backend (server), and they communicate only through an API. This modern approach ensures scalability, security, and flexibility.
</p>

<h3>High-Level Architecture</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Client (Browser):</b> The user accesses the website, which is a static React application served from Hostinger. All UI rendering, animations, and state management happen in the user's browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>API Layer (Serverless):</b> The Node.js backend, hosted on Vercel, exists as a set of serverless functions. It has no permanent connection to the frontend; it only "wakes up" when an API request is made (e.g., a form is submitted).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Data Exchange:</b> Communication happens via HTTPS using REST API principles. The frontend sends data (in JSON format) to the backend, and the backend returns a status response (e.g., "Success" or "Error").
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>User Enquiry Workflow (Example)</h3>
<p>
  The most critical workflow is the handling of client enquiries:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A user navigates to the "Contact Us" page.</li>
  <li>They fill out the form (Name, Email, Message, etc.).</li>
  <li>The React application performs client-side validation (e.g., "Is the email format correct?").</li>
  <li>If valid, the frontend packages the form data into a JSON object.</li>
  <li>A secure `POST` request is made to the Node.js API endpoint on Vercel.</li>
  <li>The Vercel function receives the data, performs server-side sanitization to prevent security risks, and (in this project) formats an email to be sent to the company's admin.</li>
  <li>The API sends a "Success" response back to the React frontend.</li>
  <li>The frontend receives the success message and displays a "Thank you" notification to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>This decoupled flow ensures that even if the backend API fails, the frontend website remains online and accessible.</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!-- Page 8: Website Features & Modules -->
<h2>7. Website Features & Modules</h2>
<p>
  The website is structured into several key modules, each designed to fulfill a specific user need.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Home Page:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Features a dynamic, animated "hero" section to immediately capture user interest.</li>
      <li>Provides a high-level overview of the company's core services.</li>
      <li>Includes clear calls-to-action (CTAs) guiding users to key pages (e.g., "Our Services," "Contact Us").</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>About Us Page:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Details the company's history, mission, and vision.</li>
      <li>Features an interactive timeline showcasing key company milestones and achievements.</li>

    <b>Services Pages:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides dedicated, detailed pages for each of the company's main verticals: Instrumentation, Electrical, Automation, and Cybersecurity.</li>
      <li>Uses a clean, organized layout to explain the specifics of each service.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Projects Page:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A portfolio section showcasing successfully completed projects.</li>
      <li>Includes project summaries, and (where available) images or case studies.</li>
      <li>Features filters to allow users to sort projects by service type or industry.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Contact & Career Pages:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Contact Form:</b> An integrated, validated form for general and client enquiries.</li>
      <li><b>Career Form:</b> A separate, dedicated form for job applicants to submit their information and resumes.</li>
      <li>Includes an interactive map showing the company's location.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Core Technical Features:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Responsive Design:</b> The layout fluidly adapts to all screen sizes, from small mobile phones to large desktop monitors.</li>
      <li><b>Security:</b> Implemented HTTPS across the entire site. All form data is validated and sanitized to protect against common web vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<!-- Page 9: Development & Deployment -->
<h2>8. Development & Deployment</h2>

<h3>Frontend Implementation</h3>
<p>
  The frontend was built using a component-based philosophy in React. Components like 'Navbar', 'Footer', 'ServiceCard', and 'ProjectModal' were created as reusable pieces of code. This modularity made the development process efficient and will simplify future updates. State management for forms and navigation was handled using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`). Tailwind CSS was applied directly within the JSX of each component, allowing for rapid styling and easy maintenance of a consistent visual theme.
</p>

<h3>Backend & Integration</h3>
<p>
  The backend consisted of a simple Node.js server using the Express framework to create REST API endpoints. The primary endpoint (`/api/contact`) was designed to receive `POST` requests from the contact form. It used middleware for parsing JSON data and ensuring security. Upon receiving data, the backend logic would validate the inputs (a second time, on the server) before forwarding the enquiry to the company's designated email address. This API was then deployed to Vercel as a serverless function.
</p>

<h3>Hosting & Deployment</h3>
<p>
  A dual-deployment strategy was used:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Frontend:</b> The final, optimized React build (a set of static HTML, CSS, and JS files) was uploaded to Hostinger. The domain (e.g., `yfenterprises.com`) was pointed to this hosting, and an SSL certificate was configured to enforce HTTPS.</li>
    <li><b>Backend:</b> The Node.js API code was pushed to a GitHub repository. This repository was linked to a Vercel project, which automatically built and deployed the API to a serverless environment.</li>
  </ol>
  This separation is a best practice, as it allows the frontend and backend to be updated independently and optimizes performance for each.
</p>

<h3>Challenges & Learnings</h3>
<p>
  The primary challenge was integrating the complex GSAP animations with Locomotive Scroll withoutcausing performance issues (jank or lag). This required careful optimization, such as only running animations when elements were in the viewport. 
</p>


<div class="pagebreak"></div>
