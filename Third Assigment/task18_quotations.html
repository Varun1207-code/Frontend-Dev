            <h2>Long Quotation (Blockquote)</h2>

                <p>The best way to learn HTML &amp; CSS is through practice and experimentation. 
                Building real projects helps you understand how different elements work together 
                to create meaningful web experiences. Remember that web development is not just 
                about writing code &lt;tag&gt;elements&lt;/tag&gt;, but about creating accessible 
                and user-friendly interfaces that serve real human needs.</p>

            <h2>Short Quotations in Context</h2>
            
            <!-- Paragraph with inline short quotes using q tag -->
            <p>
                As the famous saying goes, <q>Practice makes perfect &amp; persistence pays off.</q> 
                This is especially true in web development where continuous learning is essential. 
                Many successful developers started with simple HTML pages, and as one mentor advised, 
                <q>Don't be afraid to make mistakes &lt;br&gt; they're your best teachers.</q>
            </p>

            <p>
                The HTML specification states that <q>elements must be properly nested &amp; closed</q> 
                to ensure valid markup. This fundamental rule helps maintain document structure and 
                browser compatibility.

            <h2>Mixed Quotation Example</h2>
            
            <p>
                During our HTML training session, the instructor emphasized the importance of semantic markup. 
                She said, <q>Always choose the right element for the content's meaning, not its appearance.</q>
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>HTML entities are crucial for displaying special characters correctly. Characters like 
                &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, and &quot; have special meaning in HTML and must be encoded to display 
                as literal text. This prevents parsing errors &amp; ensures your content displays exactly 
                as intended across all browsers and devices.</p>
                <cite>- HTML Best Practices Guide</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The guide also mentioned that <q>proper encoding prevents XSS attacks &amp; maintains document integrity,</q> 
                which is why understanding HTML entities is so important for web developers.
